## How do I suggest new or different data sources?

If you have feedback on the data sources we have used or have suggestions for new data sources then please email us at <a href="mailto:{{site.email_contacts.questions}}">{{site.email_contacts.questions}}</a>.

## What does the reporting status mean?

We have used three different types of reporting status for an indicator, which are also colour coded:

* Reported online (black) – the data for this indicator is available on this website, but the data might not be fully disaggregated yet. 
* Statistics in progress (grey) – we have found a suitable source of data for this indicator or a relevant proxy. We are currently quality assuring the data and preparing it for publication.
* Exploring data sources (white) – we are still looking for a suitable data source for this indicator.

Where there is additional information about the status of indicator data collection and reporting, this will be displayed at the top of the indicator page.

## How often will new data be added to this site?

We will add data as soon as it has been sourced and checked. This includes new data as well as updates to data we have already published. We will continue to collect data from existing sources where possible.

## What are you doing to fill data gaps?

Data gaps still exist for individual indicators. For example, if certain measures have not yet been implemented or data still need to be collected. At the same time, we are also in discussion with other actors in the district for possible data cooperation.

## How accessible is this website?

Our aim is to make this website as accessible and usable as possible for every user. Open-SDG is working towards meeting AA level of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/understanding-wcag-20).

## Can other countries, cities or municipalities copy this website?

Yes. This site is built and hosted using 100% free software and services, so other countries and localities can freely and easily reuse our code. Technical guidance on implementing this platform is available [here](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io).
